  <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pay what you want</a> (or PWYW) is a pricing strategy where buyers pay their desired amount for a given commodity. This amount can often include zero.</p>

  <p>Turbo Tutorials has no paid tiers or any hidden access. You don't even have to subscribe. Learning is different for everybody. It should come at no cost unless the consumer feels like the content is valuable enough. This allows learners to explore freely and donate if they learnt something exciting.</p>

  <p>The goal of Turbo Tutorials is to create accessible, fast, and easy learning which fits real use-cases and teaches at turbo speed. Watch for five minutes and you have the basics down. Was it valuable? Perhaps buy the creator a coffee!</p>
